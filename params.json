  "body": "# :car: Motorized Sumobot :blue_car:\r\n\r\nThis is the Norfolk.js motorized version of [Pawel's Sumobot-jr](https://github.com/makenai/sumobot-jr/blob/master/README.md) design that we put together for [NodeBots Day](https://github.com/nodebots/nodebotsday). The main change was to the laser-cut side pieces to support gear motors (inspired by [Markus's sumobot](https://github.com/ghtomcat/sumobot)) and the laser-cut wheels have been replaced by rubber wheels. To make this beginner-friendly, we use a motor shield for wiring the motors to the arduino. However, the bot chassis design can support other motor drivers and wiring strategies.\r\n\r\nWant to make your own motorized sumobot? Here is the [parts list](https://github.com/norfolkjs/motorized-sumobot/blob/master/parts_list.md).\r\n\r\nWe also have [printable instructions](https://github.com/norfolkjs/motorized-sumobot/blob/master/assembly_instructions.pdf) and an instructional video! (thanks [Trisha](https://github.com/aureately) and [Paul](https://github.com/paulchinjr))\r\n\r\n[![Instructional Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xHns3qxffYM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHns3qxffYM)\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Install Dependencies\r\n\r\n* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download)\r\n\r\n* [Node 4](https://nodejs.org/en/)\r\n\r\nIf you're using Windows, you'll also need to install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)\r\n\r\n```\r\n  git clone https://github.com/norfolkjs/motorized-sumobot.git\r\n  cd motorized-sumobot\r\n  npm i\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Controlling Your Bot\r\n\r\n* Plug your Arduino into your computer's USB port\r\n* Flash your Arduino with the Firmata sketch:\r\n  `npm run firmata-flash`\r\n* Start the code that controls your bot!\r\n  `npm start`\r\n\r\n## Looking for More?\r\n\r\n* [The Original Pawel-Bot Sumobot-jr](http://www.sumobotkit.com)\r\n* [ETA's Node.js Soccerbot mBots](https://github.com/EmergingTechnologyAdvisors/mbot-soccer)\r\n\r\n## Special Thanks\r\n\r\n* :sparkles: [@makenai](https://github.com/makenai) :sparkles:\r\n* :sparkles: [757 Makerspace](www.757makerspace.com) and [@beauturner](https://github.com/beauturner) :sparkles:\r\n* :sparkles: [@twtomcat](https://github.com/ghtomcat) :sparkles:\r\n",
